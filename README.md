# Lawfirm-Management-System
It is a project developed to manage the Lawfirm. This project is developed using C++ language. In this project, we can store the information about the employees working in the lawfirm, the clients and the cases informatiom. The lawyer can eventually fetch the information about the client and the case simultaniously.
To add graphics, I have used the graphics.h header file of the C++.
